          the civil blocks
    - Players also have civil levels that are dependent on the players actions
      i.e. if a player digs dirt or mines stone or coal that is considered 
      manual labor and something a CivilMagus person would not do.

          players
    - The way to get into the Magicks dimension is via a portal powered by
      dark, light, and neutral mana
