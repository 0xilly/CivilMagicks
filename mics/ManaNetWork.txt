Mana Network Doc

This is a document to help me plan out the network and how it will work. This is
a temporary document and will be removed once it is implemented.

Definitions:
    Mana: The magical energy of the world.
    Node: Any block that interacts with mana.
    Generator: Any block that generates mana.
    Receiver: Any Block that can receive mana.
    Batter: anything that can store mana.

Concepts:
    - Mana is NOT created only collected using a star Node or using mobs capable
      of collecting it.
    - Star Nodes will send mana to the closes receiver node it can find
    - Mana has three types Dark/Light/Neutral
    - Nodes can only accept the type of mana they are attuned to unless the node
      is neutral.
      -There will be nodes that can convert to other manatypes
    - Every biome is  assigned a mana type if not it defaults to neutral
